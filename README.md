## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
5. Set application type to "Web application"
6. Add your domain to authorized origins (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development)
7. Copy the Client ID

### 2. OpenAI API Setup

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (keep it secure!)

### 3. Configuration

1. Open `config.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE` with your actual Google Client ID
3. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: 'your-actual-google-client-id',
    OPENAI_API_KEY: 'your-actual-openai-api-key',
    // ... other config
};
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Local Development

1. **Using a simple HTTP server** (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   
   # Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   ```

2. **Using Live Server** (VS Code extension):
   - Install the "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"

   - The application should load the login page

### Production Deployment

1. Upload all files to your web server
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for Google OAuth)
3. Update the authorized origins in Google Cloud Console with your production domain
4. Update `config.js` with production API keys
